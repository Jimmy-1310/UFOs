# UFOs

## Overview

In this challenge a dataset was provided with the information of various UFOs sightings. The objective was to not only display them on an HTML file, but also use javascript to make it interactive. Javascript was implemented to create user inputs to filter and showcase the data the user wanted for. This was done with the use of "for-loops" and "if-statements" on Javascript.

## Results

For the first time someone opens the index file, he is greated with this screen.

The steps to perform a search are:

- Scroll down to find the filter sections

## Summary

All though the site looks good and the filters are applied correctly, there is still some room for improvement.

- A drawback of this design as that it is not friendly to a new comer. There are no clear description of what options are available and this might cause people to try and enter filters that will return no data, because they do not exist on the dataset.
- An improvement to adress this situation might be to add a drop down menu with the available options.
- Laslty, I believe that adding a "Filter Data" or "Search Button" might make the site more intuitive, because some might miss the pressing enter to fitler the data and they might think that the page is not working.
